# PicoDAW
A portable music sequencer and sampler based on Raspberry Pi Pico.  

WORK IN PROGRESS. 

I am just now populating the board and attempting to bring it up. 

There's no software yet! Also, I'm hoping that the SDIO SD Card interface is fast enough to stream
some audio tracks, since the Pico only has around 250KB or RAM. :D  We'll see.
